.. P5 EDRN Theme

EDRN Theme
==========

The EDRN theme package, ``edrn.theme``, is a generic Plone-5â€“compatible theme
add-on that gives the EDRN look and feel to a Plone 5 website. Although it can
be used in any Plone 5 site, it's mainly intended to be used as an add-on for
the Early Detection Research Network site at https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/. Of
course, if other EDRN efforts are built around the Plone content management
system, this add-on can be used as a theme.
