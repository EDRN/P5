# EDRN P5 - Operational Buildout
# ==============================
#
# Use this buildout when in going into operations.
#
# Override the below settings before deploying.  These usernames+passwords
# end up in cm, so we absolutely need these to be changed and protected.


# Zope Instance Settings
# ----------------------
#
# Fill in better username+password.
[zope]
username = zope-admin
password = secret


# Supervisor Settings
# -------------------
#
# Fill in better username+password.
[supervisor]
username = supervisor-admin
password = secret


# Zope Debugging Instance
# -----------------------
#
# In operations, the debug instance also uses zeo.
[zope-debug]
zeo-client = true


# Buildout
# --------
#
# For JPL, fill in /usr/local/mcl/buildout/{eggs,downloads,extends} below.
# For NCI, the deploy.py script takes care of this.
# FIXME: We should have a single deploy.py for both environments!
