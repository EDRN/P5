<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
            Greater GSTP1 promoter methylation in cancer tissue was independently associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with early prostate cancer. 
            This suggests that GSTP1 promoter methylation may be a potential tissue based recurrence marker.
            </edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>
            We evaluated the extent of promoter methylation of genes previously reported as aberrantly methylated in prostate cancer (AIM1, APC, CCND2, GPX3, GSTP1, MCAM, RARÎ²2, SSBP2 and TIMP3) by quantitative fluorogenic methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We used cancer tissue from a nested case-control study of 452 patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Recurrence cases and controls were compared and the association between methylation extent and recurrence risk was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for patient age at prostatectomy, prostatectomy year, stage, grade, surgical margins and preprostatectomy prostate specific antigen. 
            All statistical tests were 2-sided with p &lt;= 0.05 considered statistically significant.

<edrn:StudyConclusion>The presented data show that simultaneous testing of a panel of serum cytokines and CA-125 
        using LabMAP technology may present a promising approach for ovarian cancer detection.
        </edrn:StudyConclusion>
<edrn:DataSetName>University of Pittsburg Ovarian Data</edrn:DataSetName>
<edrn:StudyResults>Concentrations of 24 cytokines (cytokines/chemokines, growth, and angiogenic 
        factors) in combination with cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), were measured in sera of 44 patients 
        with early-stage ovarian cancer, 45 healthy women, and 37 patients with benign pelvic tumors. 
        Six markers, i.e., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial 
        growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and CA-125, showed significant 
        differences in serum concentrations between ovarian cancer and control groups. Out of this group, 
        IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, EGF, and CA-125, were used in a classification tree analysis that resulted in 
        84 percent sensitivity at 95 percent specificity. The receiver operator characteristic curve created using the 
        combination of markers produced sensitivities between 90 percent and 100 percent in the area of 80 percent to 90 percent 
        specificity, whereas the receiver operator characteristic curve for CA-125 alone resulted in 
        sensitivities of 70 percent to 80 percent. The classification tree analysis for discrimination of benign 
        condition from ovarian cancer used CA-125, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, 
        EGF, and VEGF resulting in 86.5 percent sensitivity and 93.0 percent specificity.

<edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of ovarian cancer might improve 
        clinical outcome. Some studies have shown the role of cytokines as a 
        new group of tumor markers for ovarian cancer. We hypothesized that a 
        panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show 
        strong correlation with the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.
        </edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>To evaluate the diagnostic utility of cytokine panel, we used a novel multianalyte 
        LabMAP profiling technology that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple 
        markers.

<edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines
Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.

<edrn:StudyBackground>In chromosome breakage assays, validated, universal criteria for selection of cells 
        and classification of chromosome aberrations may enhance their utility for cancer susceptibility 
        screening. To standardize a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) modification of the mutagen 
        sensitivity assay (MSA), scoring criteria were evaluated by web-based validation. Two hundred digital 
        FISH images were assigned random identification numbers. With this set of images, criteria for inclusion 
        of cells and measurement of the frequency of abnormal cells were evaluated by eight observers, all of 
        whom had five or more years of experience. Observers included doctoral and MS/BS level cytogeneticists, 
        and were drawn from a randomized pool of 54 volunteers. Questions addressed were: (1) how uniformly were 
        criteria applied to analysis of a standard digital FISH image set and (2) did concordance vary with 
        educational level? These data suggest inter-rater agreement within a factor of 2 for average breakage 
        frequency, but revealed greater variability in cell selection. These results aid in estimating the 
        components of assay variance due to definitions, technical parameters and biological variables.</edrn:StudyBackground>

<edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of breast cancer might improve clinical outcome. Some studies have 
        shown the role of cytokines as a new group of tumor markers for breast cancer. We hypothesized 
        that a panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show strong correlation 
        with the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.</edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>To evaluate the diagnostic utility of cytokine panel, we used a novel multianalyte LabMAP profiling 
        technology that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple markers.</edrn:StudyMethods>

<x:protocol rdf:resource="http://edrn.nci.nih.gov/data/protocols/282"/>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:StudyConclusion>These results demonstrate that "between-laboratory" reproducibility of SELDI-TOF-MS serum profiling approaches that of 
        "within-laboratory" reproducibility as determined by measuring discrete m/z peaks over time and across laboratories.</edrn:StudyConclusion>
<edrn:DataSetName>EVMS Mass Spec Data</edrn:DataSetName>
<edrn:StudyResults>When the described standard operating procedures were established at all laboratory sites, the across-laboratory 
        measurements revealed a CV for mass accuracy of 0.1 percent, signal-to-noise ratio of 40 percent, and normalized intensity of 15-36 percent 
        for the three pooled serum peaks. This was comparable to the intralaboratory measurements of the same peaks. The instrument 
        systems were then challenged with sera from a selected group of 14 cases and 14 controls. The classification agreement 
        between each site and the established decision algorithm were examined by use of both raw peak intensity boosting and ranked 
        peak intensity boosting. All six sites achieved perfect blinded classification for all samples when boosted alignment of raw 
        intensities was used. Four of six sites achieved perfect blinded classification with ranked intensities, with one site passing 
        the criteria of 26 of 28 correct and one site failing with 19 of 28 correct.

<edrn:StudyBackground>Protein expression profiling for differences indicative of early cancer has promise for improving 
        diagnostics. This report describes the first stage of a National Cancer Institute/Early Detection Research 
        Network-sponsored multiinstitutional evaluation and validation of this approach for detection of prostate cancer.</edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>Two sequential experimental phases were conducted to establish interlaboratory calibration and standardization 
        of the surface-enhanced laser desorption (SELDI) instrumental and assay platform output. We first established whether 
        the output from multiple calibrated Protein Biosystem II SELDI-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) 
        instruments demonstrated acceptable interlaboratory reproducibility. This was determined by measuring mass accuracy, 
        resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and normalized intensity of three m/z "peaks" present in a standard pooled serum 
        sample. We next evaluated the ability of the calibrated and standardized instrumentation to accurately differentiate 
        between selected cases of prostate cancer and control by use of an algorithm developed from data derived from a single 
        site 2 years earlier.

<edrn:MethodDetails>The data was produced at the USC Epigenome Center Core. Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite converted with the Zymo EZ96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Bisulfite conversion quality was assessed using four MethyLight reactions (Campan M, Methods Mol Biol., 2009). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then whole-genome amplified, fragmented, then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChips. Each locus has corresponding methylated and un-methylated bead types. Single-base extension using labeled nucleotides is only accomplished upon correct allele-specific primer annealing to the appropriate bead type.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines
Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.

<edrn:Description>40 NSCLC cell lines / 83 lung adenocarcinoma tumor pairs</edrn:Description>
<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>TBD</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell culture
The lung cancer cells are grown in lysine free media supplemented with 13C6 lysine for 7 passage to insure &gt;90 percent incorporation of isotopic labeled amino acid. 

Secreted or Shed protein
Media was changed to media with 0.1percent dialyzed FBS and incubated for 48 hours prior to collecting the conditioned media. Cells and debris are removed from media by centrifugation at 5000xg and filtration through a 0.22um filter. The conditioned media is then concentrated with Amicon 3K centrifugal filters. 

Cell surface and membrane proteins
Cell surface proteins from 2.0x108 cells will be biotinylated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, solubilized in solution containing Igepal CA-630 with cell disruption by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20000xg. Biotinylated proteins are chromatographically isolated by affinity chromatography using 1ml of Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin. Proteins bound to the column are recovered by reduction of the biotinylation reagent with 5ml of a solution containing 65umol of DTT and 1percent octyl-glucoside.

Total cell extracts
Total cell extracts are obtained by sonication of 2.0x107cells in 1ml of PBS containing 1percent octyl-glucoside and protease inhibitors followed by sonication and centrifugation at 20000xg.  

Conditioned media, cell surface proteins and total cell extract were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Each one of the reverse-phase fractions were individually digested in-solution digestion with trypsin and grouped into 24 pools according to chromatographic features. Pools are individually analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ-ORBITRAP mass spectrometer.

The acquired mass spectrometric data is analyzed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) analysis pipeline which provides peptide and protein identification. The spectral counting method is used to estimate protein enrichment for each compartment</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:PlannedSampleSize>The EDRN-Prostate-SELDI Investigational Collaboration (EPSIC) will implement a process to 
	         synchronize SELDI output at the seven participating institutions using a single source of pooled 
	         normal sera (QC). The target was to recruit 100 healthy males and 100 healthy females to donate 
	         two tubes of blood. Pregnant women and subjects less than 110 pounds were excluded from the blood 
	         collection. An IRB protocol was submitted two months in advance of the project. After IRB approval, 
	         fliers were generated and posted at many locations (e.g., EVMS, hospitals, doctor's offices). The 
	         blood was collected on November 6, 2002 from 7:30 am to 2:00 pm. A total of 360 healthy people (154 
	         male and 206 female) donated two tubes of blood each to make quality control (QC) serum.</edrn:PlannedSampleSize>

<edrn:MethodDetails>Two pools of samples were used in each experiment - one consisted of a pool of plasma from controls as a reference point, the other a pool of plasma from subjects with lung cancer. Each pooled sample was immunodepleted of the top six most abundant proteins (Albumin, IgG, IgA, Transferrin, Haptoglobin, and R-1-Antitrypsin) prior to further analysis. The two pools were isotopic labeling (cysteine) and mixed before separating by anion-exchange chromatography. A total of 8 pools were collected and further separated by reverse phase chromatography. A total of 96 fractions were collected for each experiment.

Each fraction is trypsinated and analyzed by a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer coupled to a nano-flow chromatography system. Tandem MS analysis was triggered on the 5 most abundant  2 or  3 ions of each MS1 with a dynamic exclusion list.

Acquired data were processed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System pipeline. This pipeline implements the X!Tandem search algorithm with comet score module plug-in against IPI human v3.13 sequence database. Identified peptides were further validated through PeptideProphet and inferred into proteins via ProteinProphet. A merged database search was also performed on all the spectra collected from 96 fractions of each experiment.
 
The relative quantification for each pair of peptides that contains cysteine residues was computed by Q3ProteinRatioParser. Only peptides with a minimum PeptideProphet score of 0.75, and mass deviation &lt;20 ppm were considered for quantification. Ratios on a logarithmic scale of all quantified peptides were plotted on a histogram and the median of the distribution was centered at zero. All normalized peptide ratios for a specific protein were averaged to compute an overall protein ratio. Statistical significance of the protein quantitative information was obtained via two procedures: for proteins with multiple peptides quantified, a P-value for the mean log-ratio, which has mean zero under the null hypothesis, was calculated using one-sample t-test; and for proteins with a single quantitative event, the probability for the ratio was extrapolated from the distribution of ratios in a baseline-baseline experiment whereby the same sample was split in half and labeled differentially.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:Description>40 NSCLC cell lines / 83 lung adenocarcinoma tumor pairs</edrn:Description>
<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>TBD</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

<edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines
Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment.  Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number.  A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data).  Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data).  A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.

Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell culture
The lung cancer cells are grown in lysine free media supplemented with 13C6 lysine for 7 passage to insure &gt;90 percent incorporation of isotopic labeled amino acid. 

Secreted or Shed protein
Media was changed to media with 0.1percent dialyzed FBS and incubated for 48 hours prior to collecting the conditioned media. Cells and debris are removed from media by centrifugation at 5000xg and filtration through a 0.22um filter. The conditioned media is then concentrated with Amicon 3K centrifugal filters. 

Cell surface and membrane proteins
Cell surface proteins from 2.0x108 cells will be biotinylated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, solubilized in solution containing Igepal CA-630 with cell disruption by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20000xg. Biotinylated proteins are chromatographically isolated by affinity chromatography using 1ml of Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin. Proteins bound to the column are recovered by reduction of the biotinylation reagent with 5ml of a solution containing 65umol of DTT and 1percent octyl-glucoside.

Total cell extracts
Total cell extracts are obtained by sonication of 2.0x107cells in 1ml of PBS containing 1percent octyl-glucoside and protease inhibitors followed by sonication and centrifugation at 20000xg.  

Conditioned media, cell surface proteins and total cell extract were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Each one of the reverse-phase fractions were individually digested in-solution digestion with trypsin and grouped into 24 pools according to chromatographic features. Pools are individually analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ-ORBITRAP mass spectrometer.

The acquired mass spectrometric data is analyzed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) analysis pipeline which provides peptide and protein identification. The spectral counting method is used to estimate protein enrichment for each compartment</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>Our findings suggest potential utility of an approach to diagnosis of lung cancer before onset of symptoms that includes screening for autoantibodies to defined antigens. </edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Proteins from human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 lysates were subjected to extensive fractionation. The resulting 1,824 fractions were spotted in 
duplicate on nitrocellulose-coated slides. The microarrays produced were used in a blinded validation study to determine whether annexin I, PGP9.5, and 14-3-3 theta 
antigens previously found to be targets of autoantibodies in newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer are associated with autoantibodies in sera collected at the
presymptomatic stage and to determine whether additional antigens may be identified in prediagnostic sera. Individual sera collected from 85 patients within 1 year
before a diagnosis of lung cancer and 85 matched controls from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort were hybridized to individual microarrays.
For combined analysis, the markers were integrated by a summation of dichotomized markers, whereby each marker was dichotomized by its optimal cutoff point, which 
corresponds to the minimum classification error rate. The 95 percent CI band of the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated from 500 bootstrap procedures. 
The combination rule should be treated as a discovered biomarker and provides information on the complementarities of informative antigens.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>The Pre-PLCO datasets contain 59 markers measured by 4 sites (Partners, FHCRC, MD Anderson, and Pittsburgh).  The best performers were selected to be measured in PLCO samples.</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Pre PLCO datasets (Phase II):
        This phase II set consisted of 160 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer with specimens obtained from FHCRC, 
        Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC, AKG), MDACC, and Partners.  Approximately half of the cases were early stage (I, II) 
        and half late stage (III, IV). Also included was a benign disease group of 160 cases.  There were 480 general population 
        controls assembled from the four sites.  The healthy controls were recruited in the context of selection from the 
        general population as controls for an ovarian cancer case-control study or from attendees at mammographic screening 
        clinics.  Forty paired serial specimens from healthy controls were obtained from women participating in regular mammography 
        screening (FHCRC) and 84 replicates were constructed from pooled female sera available for laboratory standardization (ProMedDX, 
        Norton, MA).  All cases had blood drawn prior to surgery or chemotherapy and processed for serum generally within four hours of 
        draws.  The serum was stored in aliquots at -80 C.  Controls had blood drawn, processed, and stored under conditions similar to 
        the cases at each contributing sites.  All subjects were accrued between 1998 and 2006 under IRB approved protocols.
        
        All of the common phase II specimens were banked at the individual sites contributing specimens.  Two ml aliquots of blood for all 
        subjects selected were assembled from the sites listed above and sent to FCCC for separation into aliquots and re-labeling to blind 
        their source and case or control status.   Four aliquots were prepared: 0.3 ml to go to FHCRC, 0.1 ml to go MDACC, and 1.4 ml to go 
        to Partners, and 0.2 ml to go to UPCI.  Specimens for each set were organized so there would be similar ratios of cases, benign disease 
        controls, general population controls, paired serial, and quality control specimens in batch sizes of 96.  Aliquots were express-shipped 
        on dry ice.  
        
        Laboratory Assays
        
        Laboratory assays for the phase II study were conducted at the four separate laboratories by individuals who were blind to case or control 
        status for the phase II specimens.  Assays included single- or multi-plex Luminex bead assays, plate-based ELISA assays, platform-based 
        (Roche E170) assays, and a mass spectroscopy-based system using surface enhanced antibody chips.  With the exceptions noted below, the assays 
        used for the phase III specimens were also used for the phase II specimens.
        
        At FHCRC single-plex Luminex bead assays were used for all markers, details of which can be found in (Shah CA, Lowe KA, Paley P, Wallace E, Anderson 
        GL, McIntosh MW, Andersen MR, Scholler N, Bergan LA, Thorpe JD, Urban N, and Drescher CW, Influence of ovarian cancer risk status on the diagnostic 
        performance of the serum biomarkers mesothelin, HE4, and CA125. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2009. 18(5): p. 1365-72.).  MDACC used a 
        mass spectroscopy based system for its markers, described in (Zhang Z, Bast RC, Jr., Yu Y, Li J, Sokoll LJ, Rai AJ, Rosenzweig JM, Cameron B, Wang YY, 
        Meng XY, Berchuck A, Van Haaften-Day C, Hacker NF, de Bruijn HW, van der Zee AG, Jacobs IJ, Fung ET, and Chan DW, Three biomarkers identified from 
        serum proteomic analysis for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Cancer Res, 2004. 64(16): p. 5882-90.).    Partners used plate-based
         assay for B7-H4(Diadexus), DcR3(Diadexus), CA72.4, IGF 2, Mesothelin, HE4, and Kallikrein 6 (as described in (Diamandis EP, Scorilas A, Fracchioli S, 
         Van Gramberen M, De Bruijn H, Henrik A, Soosaipillai A, Grass L, Yousef GM, Stenman UH, Massobrio M, Van Der Zee AG, Vergote I, and Katsaros D, 
         Human kallikrein 6 (hK6): a new potential serum biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian carcinoma. J Clin Oncol, 2003. 21(6): p. 1035-43)).  
         Platform-based assays (Roche) were used for CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA.  Unless the volume was insufficient assays were run in duplicate and 
         averaged.  Seven markers were carried over to phase III and these included B7H4, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, CA72.4, HE4, and HK 6.   The same assays were used 
         except that a platform-based assay was available for CA72.4.   The two 0.3 aliquots were first combined and homogenized.  UPCI used a multi-plex bead assay 
         system was used to evaluate 34 markers in phase II.  This technique is described in (Nolen B, Marrangoni A, Velikokhatnaya L, Prosser D, Winans M, Gorelik E, 
         and Lokshin A, A serum based analysis of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis. Gynecol Oncol, 2009. 112(1): p. 47-54). For the phase II markers included in the 
         Yale panel, these markers were evaluated using a multi-plex bead system described in (Visintin I, Feng Z, Longton G, Ward DC, Alvero AB, Lai Y, Tenthorey J, 
         Leiser A, Flores-Saaib R, Yu H, Azori M, Rutherford T, Schwartz PE, and Mor G, Diagnostic markers for early detection of ovarian cancer. Clin Cancer Res, 2008.

<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>The PLCO datasets contain 35 markers measured by five sites (Partners, FHCRC, MD Anderson, Pittsburgh, and Yale)</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>PLCO datasets (Phase III):
        
        The Phase III study was coordinated by the PLCO.  Sample collection, processing, shipping and storage were standardized across 
        all screening sites.  Briefly, blood was drawn and processed within 2 hours into vials (~1.8ml) of serum/plasma, buffy coat and 
        red blood cells. A unique specimen identification number was generated for each vial and daughter vial created.  Vials were 
        stored at -70 Â°C and shipped to the central biorepository overnight on dry ice for long-term storage at -70Â°C or -157 Â°C. 
        By June of 2006, 118 cases of invasive ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers with available samples had been 
        confirmed. Tumors of âborderline malignancyâ were excluded.    Serum samples most proximate to diagnosis were selected.  Controls 
        were selected from a pool of healthy individuals who remained cancer free and were matched to cases by five year age categories at 
        blood draw, calendar year of blood draw.  Women who reported a history of cancer or oophorectomy at baseline were excluded from control 
        selection. For each case, 8 healthy controls were selected: 4 randomly selected from a pool of all eligible controls and representing 
        general population controls; 2 with positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer; and 2 with history of an elevated CA125.  Sixty 
        replicate pairs were randomly inserted into the batches for blinded QC; ten pairs of which had CA125 values greater than 25 U/ml.  
        
        PLCO serum samples to be allocated are at the PLCO biorepository in Frederick, Md. One vial containing 1.8ml of serum was pulled from the 
        PLCO biorepository for each selected subject and was sent to the PLCO central processing lab for aliquoting. Aliquots of desired amounts 
        for each investigator teams were made side by side in small batches to avoid repeated freeze-thaw, and to minimize variability in handling.  
        FHCRC received 0.3 ml, MDACC 0.1 ml, Partners two 0.6ml aliquots, and Pittsburgh 0.2 ml, and YUSM 0.2 ml.  Aliquots were labeled with a 
        unique sample ID, and were randomly ordered such that cases and controls were evenly distributed, then packed into 81-cell freezer boxes 
        and kept frozen. Prior to shipping, the laboratories were notified of the shipment 24 hours in advance. Aliquots were shipped overnight on 
        dry ice.  A shipping manifest containing aliquot IDs was included in the package and was also emailed to the laboratories.  Each laboratory 
        received aliquots of identical sets of samples. 
        
        Laboratory Assays
        
        Laboratory assays for the phase III PLCO study were conducted at the four separate laboratories by individuals who were blind to case or control 
        status for both the phase II and phase III specimens.  Assays included single- or multi-plex Luminex bead assays, plate-based ELISA assays, platform-based 
        (Roche E170) assays, and a mass spectroscopy-based system using surface enhanced antibody chips.  With the exceptions noted below, the assays used for 
        the phase III specimens were also used for the phase II specimens.
        
        At FHCRC single-plex Luminex bead assays were used for all markers, details of which can be found in (Shah CA, Lowe KA, Paley P, Wallace E, Anderson GL, McIntosh MW, 
        Andersen MR, Scholler N, Bergan LA, Thorpe JD, Urban N, and Drescher CW, Influence of ovarian cancer risk status on the diagnostic performance of the serum biomarkers 
        mesothelin, HE4, and CA125. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2009. 18(5): p. 1365-72.).   The same assays were carried over into phase III except that a plate based 
        assay for MMP-7 was introduced.  MDACC used a mass spectroscopy based system for its markers in both phases  further described in (Zhang Z, Bast RC, Jr., Yu Y, Li J, 
        Sokoll LJ, Rai AJ, Rosenzweig JM, Cameron B, Wang YY, Meng XY, Berchuck A, Van Haaften-Day C, Hacker NF, de Bruijn HW, van der Zee AG, Jacobs IJ, Fung ET, and Chan DW, 
        Three biomarkers identified from serum proteomic analysis for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Cancer Res, 2004. 64(16): p. 5882-90.).    Partners used plate-based 
        assay for B7-H4(Diadexus), DcR3(Diadexus), CA72.4, IGF 2, Mesothelin, HE4, and Kallikrein 6 (as described in (Diamandis EP, Scorilas A, Fracchioli S, Van Gramberen M, De Bruijn H, 
        Henrik A, Soosaipillai A, Grass L, Yousef GM, Stenman UH, Massobrio M, Van Der Zee AG, Vergote I, and Katsaros D, Human kallikrein 6 (hK6): a new potential serum biomarker for 
        diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian carcinoma. J Clin Oncol, 2003. 21(6): p. 1035-43)).  Platform-based assays (Roche) were used for CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA.  Unless the volume 
        was insufficient assays were run in duplicate and averaged.  Seven markers were carried over to phase III and these included B7H4, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, CA72.4, HE4, and HK 6.   
        The same assays were used except that a platform-based assay was available for CA72.4.   The two 0.3 aliquots were first combined and homogenized.  UPCI used a multi-plex bead 
        assay system was used to evaluate 34 markers in phase II.  This technique is described in (Nolen B, Marrangoni A, Velikokhatnaya L, Prosser D, Winans M, Gorelik E, and Lokshin A, 
        A serum based analysis of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis. Gynecol Oncol, 2009. 112(1): p. 47-54).  For phase III, the number of markers was reduced to 8 but the same technique 
        was used.  For the phase II markers included in the Yale panel, these markers were evaluated using a multi-plex bead system described in (Visintin I, Feng Z, Longton G, Ward DC, 
        Alvero AB, Lai Y, Tenthorey J, Leiser A, Flores-Saaib R, Yu H, Azori M, Rutherford T, Schwartz PE, and Mor G, Diagnostic markers for early detection of ovarian cancer. Clin Cancer
        Res, 2008. 14(4): p. 1065-72).  For the phase III specimens the same markers were carried over but the analyses were performed by Laboratory Corporation of America.

<edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of pancreatic cancer might improve clinical outcome. Some studies 
        have shown the role of cytokines as a new group of tumor markers for pancreatic cancer. We hypothesized 
        that a panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show strong correlation with 
        the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.</edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>To evaluate the diagnostic utility of cytokine panel, we used a novel multianalyte LabMAP 
        profiling technology that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple markers.</edrn:StudyMethods>

<edrn:StudyConclusion>Our data indicates that transcriptome profiling with a single methodology will not fully assess the expression of all genes in a cell line. A combination of transcription profiling technologies such as DNA array and MPSS provides a more robust means to assess the expression profile of an RNA sample. Finally, genes that were differentially expressed in cell lines were also differentially expressed in primary prostate cancer and its metastases.
        </edrn:StudyConclusion>
<edrn:DataSetName>University of Washington Microarray Data</edrn:DataSetName>
<edrn:StudyResults>Comparison of the data revealed that both technologies detected genes the other did not. 
        In LNCaP, 3,180 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,169 genes were only detected by MPSS. Similarly, 
        in C4-2, 4,121 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,014 genes were only detected by MPSS. Analysis of the 
        combined transcriptomes identified 66 genes unique to LNCaP cells and 33 genes unique to C4-2 cells. Expression 
        analysis of these genes in prostate cancer specimens showed CA1 to be highly expressed in bone metastasis but not 
        expressed in primary tumor and EPHA7 to be expressed in normal prostate and primary tumor but not bone metastasis.

<edrn:StudyBackground>Affymetrix GeneChip Array and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) 
         are two high throughput methodologies used to profile transcriptomes. Each method has certain 
         strengths and weaknesses; however, no comparison has been made between the data derived from Affymetrix 
         arrays and MPSS. In this study, two lineage-related prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2, were 
         used for transcriptome analysis with the aim of identifying genes associated with prostate cancer progression.
         </edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>Affymetrix GeneChip array and MPSS analyses were performed. Data was analyzed with GeneSpring 6.2 
        and in-house perl scripts. Expression array results were verified with RT-PCR.

<edrn:MethodDetails>The data was produced at the USC Epigenome Center Core. Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite converted with the Zymo EZ96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Bisulfite conversion quality was assessed using four MethyLight reactions (Campan M, Methods Mol Biol., 2009). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then whole-genome amplified, fragmented, then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChips. Each locus has corresponding methylated and un-methylated bead types. Single-base extension using labeled nucleotides is only accomplished upon correct allele-specific primer annealing to the appropriate bead type.</edrn:MethodDetails>

<edrn:PlannedSampleSize>The EDRN-Prostate-SELDI Investigational Collaboration (EPSIC) will implement a process to synchronize 
	         SELDI output at the seven participating institutions using a single source of pooled normal sera (QC). The 
	         target was to recruit 100 healthy males and 100 healthy females to donate two tubes of blood. Pregnant 
	         women and subjects less than 110 pounds were excluded from the blood collection. An IRB protocol was submitted

<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>In the current study, with specificity at 0.9, sensitivities of progression prediction approached 50 percent based on both the 8-marker panel alone and 8-marker-plus-age panel in all three models. These findings indicate 
        that even while performing at high specificity, these biomarker models predicted half of progressors to HGD and EAC that would not have been diagnosed earlier without using these biomarkers. 
        
        Based on age alone, with specificity at 90 percent, only 17.6 percent, 23.2 percent and 22.1 percent of progressors were predicted in the three models. However, with panels based on age plus biomarkers or on biomarkers alone, approximately 60 percent, 50 percent 
        and 50 percent of progressors were accurately predicted in these three models. Predicted progressors represent patients in whom we can intercede earlier, resulting in higher cure rates. Finally, our combined risk model outperformed 
        known risk in the general BE population (7.5 percent progression risk over 5 years), both in terms of negative predictive value (1.3 percent progression risk over 5 years for the low-risk group) and positive predictive value (27 percent progression 
        risk over 5 years for the high-risk group).
        
        The current findings suggest that this 8-marker panel is more objective and quantifiable and possesses higher predictive sensitivity and specificity than do clinical features, including age.
       </edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Laboratory:
        
        One hundred ninety-five Barrett's Esophagus (BE) biopsies (145 nonprogressors and 50 progressors) were obtained from five participating 
        centers: the Mayo Clinic at Rochester/Jacksonville, the University of Arizona, the University of North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins University. 
        Bisulfite treatment was performed and promoter methylation levels of 8 genes (p16, HPP1, RUNX3, CDH13, TAC1, NELL1, AKAP12 and SST) were determined 
        by qMSP on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection (Taqman) System. beta-actin was used for normalization. A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of 
        CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). A normalized methylation value (NMV) for each gene of interest was defined as described.(11) 
        Wetlab analysts (ZJ and YC) and all SJM laboratory personnel were blinded to specimen progressor or nonprogressor status.
        
        Statistical analysis:
        
        Associations between progression status and patient characteristics were tested using Student's t-test or Chi-squared testing. Relationships between biomarkers 
        and patient progression status were examined using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. To evaluate the predictive utility of the markers, we constructed receiver operating 
        characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curve analyses were first conducted on individual markers, then in combination to determine whether a panel performed better than 
        any single marker. Our algorithm rendered a single composite score, using the linear predictor from a binary regression model justified under the linearity assumption. 
        The predictive accuracy of composite scores was evaluated based on a resampling algorithm: we randomly split data into a learning set containing 2/3 and a test set including 
        1/3 of observations. The combination rule derived from the learning set produced two ROC curves, from the learning and test sets, respectively. Vertical differences between 
        these two ROC curves yielded the overestimation of sensitivities at given specificities. This procedure was repeated 200 times, and these 200 differences were averaged to 
        estimate the expected overfitting. 
        
        We also utilized predictiveness curves to display risk distribution as a function of the combined marker in the population. This curve represents a plot of risk associated with the vth quantile of the marker, 
        P{D=1|Y =F-1(v)} vs. v, with F(.) the cumulative distribution of the marker. These plots display population proportions at different risk levels more clearly than do other metrics (like ROC curves). Since a 
        case-control sample was studied, we used an external progression prevalence rate to calculate risk in the targeted screening population. To calibrate for future samples, a shrinkage coefficient estimated 
        from the logistic regression model was applied to the linear predictors from which risk was calculated. All analyses were performed in R (http://www.r-project.org). Statistical data analysts (Y.Z., W.G., and Z.F.) 
        were blinded to the identities of the 8 biomarkers.

<edrn:AnalyticResults>No significant difference in miRNA expression between cell lines from non-smokers vs. smokers was observed with the sample sizes used. 
	Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between EGFR mutant (n=10) and EGFR wild-type (n=30) cell lines:
- miR-205/miR-141/miR-200c are over-expressed in EGFR mutant cell lines
A key function of these miRNAs is to maintain the epithelial cell state by suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
Expression of these miRNAs was correlated with epithelial markers such as EPCAM and Claudin 7 in gene expression profiling data
It is consistent with prior reports that lung cancer arising in non-smokers have higher expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin

<edrn:StudyObjective>This work addresses the problem of extracting signal content
				from protein mass spectrometry data.
				A multiscale decomposition of these spectra is used to focus on local
				scale-based structure by defining
				scale-specific features. Quantification of features is accompanied by an efficient
				method for calculating
				the location of features which avoids estimation of signal-to-noise
				ratios or bandwidths.</edrn:StudyObjective>

<edrn:Description>40 NSCLC cell lines / 83 lung adenocarcinoma tumor pairs</edrn:Description>
<edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>TBD</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.

<edrn:StudyDescription>We are investigating the molecular basis of cell-cell interaction in the 
        differentiation of epithelial cells of the human bladder. Our approach involves 
        cell-type identification by CD cell surface molecules, isolation of specific cell 
        populations, gene expression analysis, and functional test of candidate genes in a 
        cell culture system.

<edrn:StudyConclusion>Our findings show that the histologically similar stromas of the prostate and bladder are phenotypically different, 
        and express organ-specific genes. The importance of these genes in epithelial development is suggested by their abnormal 
        expression in cancer. Among the candidates is the hormone PENK and the down-regulation of PENK expression in cancer suggests 
        a possible association with cancer development.

<edrn:StudyResults>The bladder stroma was phenotypically different from that of the prostate. Most notable was the presence 
        of a layer of CD13  cells adjacent to the urothelium. This structural feature was also seen in the mouse bladder. The 
        prostate stroma was uniformly CD13-. A number of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal 
        cells were identified. One prostate gene, proenkephalin (PENK), was of interest because it encodes a hormone. Secreted 
        proteins such as hormones and bioactive peptides are known to mediate cell-cell signaling. Prostate stromal expression 
        of PENK was verified by an antibody raised against a PENK peptide, by RT-PCR analysis of laser-capture microdissected 
        stromal cells, and by database analysis. Gene expression analysis showed that PENK expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer.

<edrn:StudyBackground>Stromal mesenchyme cells play an important role in epithelial differentiation 
        and likely in cancer as well. Induction of epithelial differentiation is organ-specific, and 
        the genes responsible could be identified through a comparative genomic analysis of the stromal 
        cells from two different organs. These genes might be aberrantly expressed in cancer since cancer 
        could be viewed as due to a defect in stromal signaling. We propose to identify the prostate stromal 
        genes by analysis of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal cells, and 
        to examine their expression in prostate cancer.
        </edrn:StudyBackground>
<edrn:StudyMethods>Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to cluster designation (CD) cell surface antigens was 
        first used to characterize the stromas of the prostate and bladder. Stromal cells were prepared from 
        either prostate or bladder tissue for cell culture. RNA was isolated from the cultured cells and analyzed 
        by DNA microarrays. Expression of candidate genes in normal prostate and prostate cancer was examined by RT-PCR.

<edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: 

Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab  were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.)

Tumors:

Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples.

DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation:

Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA  using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems).

Mutation analysis:
	
Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation.

Copy number analysis

Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were  performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler.  The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c  alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA.

Microarray analysis

RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>
