    <edrn:DatasetDescription>These data come from a dilution experiment aimed at elucidating which features in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data are informative for quantifying peptide content. The details of the experiment are described in [1]. The primary dataset consists of 250 spectra collected from 5 different serum sources (5 people from a health study), each subject to 10 different concentrations of a peptide mixture that contained several known peptides. Each of the 50 prepared samples were spotted, randomly, 5 times each on a single plate producing a total of 5x10x5 = 250 spectra. An additional 30 spectra arise from: 2 replicate spectra from each of the 10 concentrations of the peptide mixture, plus 2 replicates of serum-only spectra from each of the 5 serum samples. NOTE: An error was made during the process of randomly spotting samples to the plate: one of the replicates from concentration 6 was spotted on top of a serum-only sample. The result is that two spectra from this design are missing: serum 1, concentration 6, replicate 4 (column number 36 in Spectra.txt), and serum 4, concentration 0, replicate 2. This left one empty spot on the plate (column number 280 in Spectra.txt) to which we spotted a sample containing only cytochrome c. The latter was not used in any subsequent analysis in [1], and no adjustment was made for former in the analysis in [1] (column #36 was used as is).</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:DataCustodian>Allison Vitonis</edrn:DataCustodian>
    <edrn:MethodDetails>PLCO datasets (Phase III): The Phase III study was coordinated by the PLCO. Sample collection, processing, shipping and storage were standardized across all screening sites. Briefly, blood was drawn and processed within 2 hours into vials (~1.8ml) of serum/plasma, buffy coat and red blood cells. A unique specimen identification number was generated for each vial and daughter vial created. Vials were stored at -70C and shipped to the central biorepository overnight on dry ice for long-term storage at -70C or -157C. By June of 2006, 118 cases of invasive ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers with available samples had been confirmed. Tumors of "borderline malignancy" were excluded. Serum samples most proximate to diagnosis were selected. Controls were selected from a pool of healthy individuals who remained cancer free and were matched to cases by five year age categories at blood draw, calendar year of blood draw. Women who reported a history of cancer or oophorectomy at baseline were excluded from control selection. For each case, 8 healthy controls were selected: 4 randomly selected from a pool of all eligible controls and representing general population controls; 2 with positive family history of breast or ovarian cancer; and 2 with history of an elevated CA125. Sixty replicate pairs were randomly inserted into the batches for blinded QC; ten pairs of which had CA125 values greater than 25 U/ml. PLCO serum samples to be allocated are at the PLCO biorepository in Frederick, Md. One vial containing 1.8ml of serum was pulled from the PLCO biorepository for each selected subject and was sent to the PLCO central processing lab for aliquoting. Aliquots of desired amounts for each investigator teams were made side by side in small batches to avoid repeated freeze-thaw, and to minimize variability in handling. FHCRC received 0.3 ml, MDACC 0.1 ml, Partners two 0.6ml aliquots, and Pittsburgh 0.2 ml, and YUSM 0.2 ml. Aliquots were labeled with a unique sample ID, and were randomly ordered such that cases and controls were evenly distributed, then packed into 81-cell freezer boxes and kept frozen. Prior to shipping, the laboratories were notified of the shipment 24 hours in advance. Aliquots were shipped overnight on dry ice. A shipping manifest containing aliquot IDs was included in the package and was also emailed to the laboratories. Each laboratory received aliquots of identical sets of samples. Laboratory Assays Laboratory assays for the phase III PLCO study were conducted at the four separate laboratories by individuals who were blind to case or control status for both the phase II and phase III specimens. Assays included single- or multi-plex Luminex bead assays, plate-based ELISA assays, platform-based (Roche E170) assays, and a mass spectroscopy-based system using surface enhanced antibody chips. With the exceptions noted below, the assays used for the phase III specimens were also used for the phase II specimens. At FHCRC single-plex Luminex bead assays were used for all markers, details of which can be found in (Shah CA, Lowe KA, Paley P, Wallace E, Anderson GL, McIntosh MW, Andersen MR, Scholler N, Bergan LA, Thorpe JD, Urban N, and Drescher CW, Influence of ovarian cancer risk status on the diagnostic performance of the serum biomarkers mesothelin, HE4, and CA125. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2009. 18(5): p. 1365-72.). The same assays were carried over into phase III except that a plate based assay for MMP-7 was introduced. MDACC used a mass spectroscopy based system for its markers in both phases further described in (Zhang Z, Bast RC, Jr., Yu Y, Li J, Sokoll LJ, Rai AJ, Rosenzweig JM, Cameron B, Wang YY, Meng XY, Berchuck A, Van Haaften-Day C, Hacker NF, de Bruijn HW, van der Zee AG, Jacobs IJ, Fung ET, and Chan DW, Three biomarkers identified from serum proteomic analysis for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Cancer Res, 2004. 64(16): p. 5882-90.). Partners used plate-based assay for B7-H4(Diadexus), DcR3(Diadexus), CA72.4, IGF 2, Mesothelin, HE4, and Kallikrein 6 (as described in (Diamandis EP, Scorilas A, Fracchioli S, Van Gramberen M, De Bruijn H, Henrik A, Soosaipillai A, Grass L, Yousef GM, Stenman UH, Massobrio M, Van Der Zee AG, Vergote I, and Katsaros D, Human kallikrein 6 (hK6): a new potential serum biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian carcinoma. J Clin Oncol, 2003. 21(6): p. 1035-43)). Platform-based assays (Roche) were used for CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA. Unless the volume was insufficient assays were run in duplicate and averaged. Seven markers were carried over to phase III and these included B7H4, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, CA72.4, HE4, and HK 6. The same assays were used except that a platform-based assay was available for CA72.4. The two 0.3 aliquots were first combined and homogenized. UPCI used a multi-plex bead assay system was used to evaluate 34 markers in phase II. This technique is described in (Nolen B, Marrangoni A, Velikokhatnaya L, Prosser D, Winans M, Gorelik E, and Lokshin A, A serum based analysis of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis. Gynecol Oncol, 2009. 112(1): p. 47-54). For phase III, the number of markers was reduced to 8 but the same technique was used. For the phase II markers included in the Yale panel, these markers were evaluated using a multi-plex bead system described in (Visintin I, Feng Z, Longton G, Ward DC, Alvero AB, Lai Y, Tenthorey J, Leiser A, Flores-Saaib R, Yu H, Azori M, Rutherford T, Schwartz PE, and Mor G, Diagnostic markers for early detection of ovarian cancer. Clin Cancer Res, 2008. 14(4): p. 1065-72). For the phase III specimens the same markers were carried over but the analyses were performed by Laboratory Corporation of America.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>Processed SELDI bioprocessor output from EVMS (Eastern Virginia Medical School), EDRN Site 92. Comma delimited file (csv) generated using Cipehergen's "Peaks" software. The baseline was smoothed using a window of 50 points and then subtracted from each spectrum. The automatic peak detection mode was used in the Peaks software with the following settings: minimum valley depth was set at 10 times the noise and the high sensitivity of minimum valley depth was set at 0.5 times the noise. To eliminate those peaks were very close to the baseline, the low sensitivity and high sensitivity of the peak height was set at 10 and 2 times the noise, respectively. The automatic peak detection slider was set at 8 for the mass region from 2 to 4 KDa, 11 for the mass region from 4 to 8 KDa, and 8 for the mass range from 8 to 40 KDa. Detected peaks and their intensity values were then exported into excel spreadsheets.</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:StudyBackground>In chromosome breakage assays, validated, universal criteria for selection of cells and classification of chromosome aberrations may enhance their utility for cancer susceptibility screening. To standardize a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) modification of the mutagen sensitivity assay (MSA), scoring criteria were evaluated by web-based validation. Two hundred digital FISH images were assigned random identification numbers. With this set of images, criteria for inclusion of cells and measurement of the frequency of abnormal cells were evaluated by eight observers, all of whom had five or more years of experience. Observers included doctoral and MS/BS level cytogeneticists, and were drawn from a randomized pool of 54 volunteers. Questions addressed were: (1) how uniformly were criteria applied to analysis of a standard digital FISH image set and (2) did concordance vary with educational level? These data suggest inter-rater agreement within a factor of 2 for average breakage frequency, but revealed greater variability in cell selection. These results aid in estimating the components of assay variance due to definitions, technical parameters and biological variables.</edrn:StudyBackground>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>The data was produced at the USC Epigenome Center Core. Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite converted with the Zymo EZ96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Bisulfite conversion quality was assessed using four MethyLight reactions (Campan M, Methods Mol Biol., 2009). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then whole-genome amplified, fragmented, then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChips. Each locus has corresponding methylated and un-methylated bead types. Single-base extension using labeled nucleotides is only accomplished upon correct allele-specific primer annealing to the appropriate bead type.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:StudyMethods>Two sequential experimental phases were conducted to establish interlaboratory calibration and standardization of the surface-enhanced laser desorption (SELDI) instrumental and assay platform output. We first established whether the output from multiple calibrated Protein Biosystem II SELDI-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) instruments demonstrated acceptable interlaboratory reproducibility. This was determined by measuring mass accuracy, resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and normalized intensity of three m/z "peaks" present in a standard pooled serum sample. We next evaluated the ability of the calibrated and standardized instrumentation to accurately differentiate between selected cases of prostate cancer and control by use of an algorithm developed from data derived from a single site 2 years earlier.</edrn:StudyMethods>

    <edrn:StudyBackground>Protein expression profiling for differences indicative of early cancer has promise for improving diagnostics. This report describes the first stage of a National Cancer Institute/Early Detection Research Network-sponsored multiinstitutional evaluation and validation of this approach for detection of prostate cancer.</edrn:StudyBackground>
    <edrn:CollaborativeGroup>Prostate and Urologic</edrn:CollaborativeGroup>
    <edrn:StudyResults>When the described standard operating procedures were established at all laboratory sites, the across-laboratory measurements revealed a CV for mass accuracy of 0.1 percent, signal-to-noise ratio of 40 percent, and normalized intensity of 15-36 percent for the three pooled serum peaks. This was comparable to the intralaboratory measurements of the same peaks. The instrument systems were then challenged with sera from a selected group of 14 cases and 14 controls. The classification agreement between each site and the established decision algorithm were examined by use of both raw peak intensity boosting and ranked peak intensity boosting. All six sites achieved perfect blinded classification for all samples when boosted alignment of raw intensities was used. Four of six sites achieved perfect blinded classification with ranked intensities, with one site passing the criteria of 26 of 28 correct and one site failing with 19 of 28 correct.</edrn:StudyResults>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Two pools of samples were used in each experiment - one consisted of a pool of plasma from controls as a reference point, the other a pool of plasma from subjects with lung cancer. Each pooled sample was immunodepleted of the top six most abundant proteins (Albumin, IgG, IgA, Transferrin, Haptoglobin, and R-1-Antitrypsin) prior to further analysis. The two pools were isotopic labeling (cysteine) and mixed before separating by anion-exchange chromatography. A total of 8 pools were collected and further separated by reverse phase chromatography. A total of 96 fractions were collected for each experiment. Each fraction is trypsinated and analyzed by a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer coupled to a nano-flow chromatography system. Tandem MS analysis was triggered on the 5 most abundant  2 or  3 ions of each MS1 with a dynamic exclusion list. Acquired data were processed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System pipeline. This pipeline implements the X!Tandem search algorithm with comet score module plug-in against IPI human v3.13 sequence database. Identified peptides were further validated through PeptideProphet and inferred into proteins via ProteinProphet. A merged database search was also performed on all the spectra collected from 96 fractions of each experiment. The relative quantification for each pair of peptides that contains cysteine residues was computed by Q3ProteinRatioParser. Only peptides with a minimum PeptideProphet score of 0.75, and mass deviation &amp;lt;20 ppm were considered for quantification. Ratios on a logarithmic scale of all quantified peptides were plotted on a histogram and the median of the distribution was centered at zero. All normalized peptide ratios for a specific protein were averaged to compute an overall protein ratio. Statistical significance of the protein quantitative information was obtained via two procedures: for proteins with multiple peptides quantified, a P-value for the mean log-ratio, which has mean zero under the null hypothesis, was calculated using one-sample t-test; and for proteins with a single quantitative event, the probability for the ratio was extrapolated from the distribution of ratios in a baseline-baseline experiment whereby the same sample was split in half and labeled differentially.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Laboratory: One hundred ninety-five Barrett's Esophagus (BE) biopsies (145 nonprogressors and 50 progressors) were obtained from five participating centers: the Mayo Clinic at Rochester/Jacksonville, the University of Arizona, the University of North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins University. Bisulfite treatment was performed and promoter methylation levels of 8 genes (p16, HPP1, RUNX3, CDH13, TAC1, NELL1, AKAP12 and SST) were determined by qMSP on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection (Taqman) System. beta-actin was used for normalization. A standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). A normalized methylation value (NMV) for each gene of interest was defined as described.(11) Wetlab analysts (ZJ and YC) and all SJM laboratory personnel were blinded to specimen progressor or nonprogressor status. Statistical analysis: Associations between progression status and patient characteristics were tested using Student's t-test or Chi-squared testing. Relationships between biomarkers and patient progression status were examined using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. To evaluate the predictive utility of the markers, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curve analyses were first conducted on individual markers, then in combination to determine whether a panel performed better than any single marker. Our algorithm rendered a single composite score, using the linear predictor from a binary regression model justified under the linearity assumption. The predictive accuracy of composite scores was evaluated based on a resampling algorithm: we randomly split data into a learning set containing 2/3 and a test set including 1/3 of observations. The combination rule derived from the learning set produced two ROC curves, from the learning and test sets, respectively. Vertical differences between these two ROC curves yielded the overestimation of sensitivities at given specificities. This procedure was repeated 200 times, and these 200 differences were averaged to estimate the expected overfitting. We also utilized predictiveness curves to display risk distribution as a function of the combined marker in the population. This curve represents a plot of risk associated with the vth quantile of the marker, P{D=1</edrn:MethodDetails>
    <edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>In the current study, with specificity at 0.9, sensitivities of progression prediction approached 50 percent based on both the 8-marker panel alone and 8-marker-plus-age panel in all three models. These findings indicate that even while performing at high specificity, these biomarker models predicted half of progressors to HGD and EAC that would not have been diagnosed earlier without using these biomarkers. Based on age alone, with specificity at 90 percent, only 17.6 percent, 23.2 percent and 22.1 percent of progressors were predicted in the three models. However, with panels based on age plus biomarkers or on biomarkers alone, approximately 60 percent, 50 percent and 50 percent of progressors were accurately predicted in these three models. Predicted progressors represent patients in whom we can intercede earlier, resulting in higher cure rates. Finally, our combined risk model outperformed known risk in the general BE population (7.5 percent progression risk over 5 years), both in terms of negative predictive value (1.3 percent progression risk over 5 years for the low-risk group) and positive predictive value (27 percent progression risk over 5 years for the high-risk group). The current findings suggest that this 8-marker panel is more objective and quantifiable and possesses higher predictive sensitivity and specificity than do clinical features, including age.</edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Proteins from human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 lysates were subjected to extensive fractionation. The resulting 1,824 fractions were spotted in duplicate on nitrocellulose-coated slides. The microarrays produced were used in a blinded validation study to determine whether annexin I, PGP9.5, and 14-3-3 theta antigens previously found to be targets of autoantibodies in newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer are associated with autoantibodies in sera collected at the presymptomatic stage and to determine whether additional antigens may be identified in prediagnostic sera. Individual sera collected from 85 patients within 1 year before a diagnosis of lung cancer and 85 matched controls from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort were hybridized to individual microarrays. For combined analysis, the markers were integrated by a summation of dichotomized markers, whereby each marker was dichotomized by its optimal cutoff point, which corresponds to the minimum classification error rate. The 95 percent CI band of the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated from 500 bootstrap procedures. The combination rule should be treated as a discovered biomarker and provides information on the complementarities of informative antigens.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>The data was produced at the USC Epigenome Center Core. Genomic DNA samples were bisulfite converted with the Zymo EZ96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Bisulfite conversion quality was assessed using four MethyLight reactions (Campan M, Methods Mol Biol., 2009). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then whole-genome amplified, fragmented, then hybridized to the Infinium HumanMethylation27K BeadChips. Each locus has corresponding methylated and un-methylated bead types. Single-base extension using labeled nucleotides is only accomplished upon correct allele-specific primer annealing to the appropriate bead type.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>Seventy- two biomarkers were analyzed in nested case control set from PLCO. Samples most proximal to diagnosis constitute cases. Healthy participants constituted controls. Data were measured/analyzed in 5 steps: Step 1. Initial training on a retrospective case/control set.The entire case/control set reported in 8 was used for training to identify optimal biomarker combinations, establish classification rules, and calculate scoring functions using the MMC algorithm (described below). This set consisted of 343 patients diagnosed with PDAC (163 men, 180 women, median age 68, age range 29-92) and 227 healthy controls (88 men, 139 women, median age 56, age range 18-87). The stage distribution for cases was 2.3% stage 1, 20% stage 2, 10% stage 3, 25% stage 4, and 39% unknown. Step 2. Validation of an initial algorithm in the first, blinded one-half of the PLCO set. The blinded one-half of the PLCO set was analyzed for biomarkers included in the optimal combinations identified in Step 1. Two scoring functions determined in Step 1 were applied to this half of the PLCO set in order to assign diagnoses to each subject. These experimental diagnoses were then forwarded to the PLCO administrators for comparison to actual diagnoses and the diagnostic efficacy [SN, SP, area under the ROC curve (AUC)] of each biomarker combination was reported back to UPCI. Step 3. Training on the first one-half of the PLCO set following unblinding.Once the results of the blinded PLCO training analysis were reported, the case/control status of those samples was unblinded in order to permit further biomarker analyses. This one-half of the set was evaluated for the entire panel of 67 biomarkers and used as a training set for developmentof improved algorithms. Step 4. Validation of the results from Step 3 in the second, blinded one-half of the PLCO set. The improved algorithm was applied to the second blinded one-half of the PLCO set and scoring functions and diagnoses (cancer/healthy) were then forwarded to the PLCO. The experimental diagnoses were again compared to the actual diagnoses and the diagnostic efficacy (SN, SP, AUC) of each biomarker combination was reported back to UPCI. Step 5. Training on the entire PLCO set. The entire PLCO set was unblinded, the full set of 67 candidate biomarkers were measured in all PLCO samples, and the entire dataset was utilized for development of a further optimized algorithm</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Pre PLCO datasets (Phase II): This phase II set consisted of 160 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer with specimens obtained from FHCRC, Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC, AKG), MDACC, and Partners. Approximately half of the cases were early stage (I, II) and half late stage (III, IV). Also included was a benign disease group of 160 cases. There were 480 general population controls assembled from the four sites. The healthy controls were recruited in the context of selection from the general population as controls for an ovarian cancer case-control study or from attendees at mammographic screening clinics. Forty paired serial specimens from healthy controls were obtained from women participating in regular mammography screening (FHCRC) and 84 replicates were constructed from pooled female sera available for laboratory standardization (ProMedDX, Norton, MA). All cases had blood drawn prior to surgery or chemotherapy and processed for serum generally within four hours of draws. The serum was stored in aliquots at -80 C. Controls had blood drawn, processed, and stored under conditions similar to the cases at each contributing sites. All subjects were accrued between 1998 and 2006 under IRB approved protocols. All of the common phase II specimens were banked at the individual sites contributing specimens. Two ml aliquots of blood for all subjects selected were assembled from the sites listed above and sent to FCCC for separation into aliquots and re-labeling to blind their source and case or control status. Four aliquots were prepared: 0.3 ml to go to FHCRC, 0.1 ml to go MDACC, and 1.4 ml to go to Partners, and 0.2 ml to go to UPCI. Specimens for each set were organized so there would be similar ratios of cases, benign disease controls, general population controls, paired serial, and quality control specimens in batch sizes of 96. Aliquots were express-shipped on dry ice. Laboratory Assays Laboratory assays for the phase II study were conducted at the four separate laboratories by individuals who were blind to case or control status for the phase II specimens. Assays included single- or multi-plex Luminex bead assays, plate-based ELISA assays, platform-based (Roche E170) assays, and a mass spectroscopy-based system using surface enhanced antibody chips. With the exceptions noted below, the assays used for the phase III specimens were also used for the phase II specimens. At FHCRC single-plex Luminex bead assays were used for all markers, details of which can be found in (Shah CA, Lowe KA, Paley P, Wallace E, Anderson GL, McIntosh MW, Andersen MR, Scholler N, Bergan LA, Thorpe JD, Urban N, and Drescher CW, Influence of ovarian cancer risk status on the diagnostic performance of the serum biomarkers mesothelin, HE4, and CA125. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2009. 18(5): p. 1365-72.). MDACC used a mass spectroscopy based system for its markers, described in (Zhang Z, Bast RC, Jr., Yu Y, Li J, Sokoll LJ, Rai AJ, Rosenzweig JM, Cameron B, Wang YY, Meng XY, Berchuck A, Van Haaften-Day C, Hacker NF, de Bruijn HW, van der Zee AG, Jacobs IJ, Fung ET, and Chan DW, Three biomarkers identified from serum proteomic analysis for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Cancer Res, 2004. 64(16): p. 5882-90.). Partners used plate-based assay for B7-H4(Diadexus), DcR3(Diadexus), CA72.4, IGF 2, Mesothelin, HE4, and Kallikrein 6 (as described in (Diamandis EP, Scorilas A, Fracchioli S, Van Gramberen M, De Bruijn H, Henrik A, Soosaipillai A, Grass L, Yousef GM, Stenman UH, Massobrio M, Van Der Zee AG, Vergote I, and Katsaros D, Human kallikrein 6 (hK6): a new potential serum biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian carcinoma. J Clin Oncol, 2003. 21(6): p. 1035-43)). Platform-based assays (Roche) were used for CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA. Unless the volume was insufficient assays were run in duplicate and averaged. Seven markers were carried over to phase III and these included B7H4, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, CA72.4, HE4, and HK 6. The same assays were used except that a platform-based assay was available for CA72.4. The two 0.3 aliquots were first combined and homogenized. UPCI used a multi-plex bead assay system was used to evaluate 34 markers in phase II. This technique is described in (Nolen B, Marrangoni A, Velikokhatnaya L, Prosser D, Winans M, Gorelik E, and Lokshin A, A serum based analysis of ovarian epithelial tumorigenesis. Gynecol Oncol, 2009. 112(1): p. 47-54). For the phase II markers included in the Yale panel, these markers were evaluated using a multi-plex bead system described in (Visintin I, Feng Z, Longton G, Ward DC, Alvero AB, Lai Y, Tenthorey J, Leiser A, Flores-Saaib R, Yu H, Azori M, Rutherford T, Schwartz PE, and Mor G, Diagnostic markers for early detection of ovarian cancer.

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.) Tumors: Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples. DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation: Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis: Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.) Tumors: Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples. DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation: Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis: Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment. Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number. A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data). Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data). A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &amp;lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &amp;gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping. 60 matched tumor normal pairs Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software.

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death worldwide, with up to 25% of cases arising in never smokers. Lung cancers in smokers and never smokers have been shown to exhibit specific genetic and clinical features which suggests they are distinct diseases. Despite these findings, there is still much to learn about lung tumorigenesis in these two groups. We hypothesized that if smoker and never smoker lung tumors are different diseases, they are likely driven by different molecular mechanisms and therefore likely exhibit different patterns of copy number alterations throughout the genome. We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to generate high resolution copy number profiles for lung adenocarcinomas from 30 smokers and 30 never smokers as well as cell lines derived from 20 smokers and 20 light or never smokers to elucidate global differences in genomic aberrations between these two groups.</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.) Tumors: Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples. DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation: Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis: Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:StudyResults>Concentrations of 24 cytokines (cytokines/chemokines, growth, and angiogenic factors) in combination with cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), were measured in sera of 44 patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, 45 healthy women, and 37 patients with benign pelvic tumors. Six markers, i.e., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and CA-125, showed significant differences in serum concentrations between ovarian cancer and control groups. Out of this group, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, EGF, and CA-125, were used in a classification tree analysis that resulted in 84 percent sensitivity at 95 percent specificity. The receiver operator characteristic curve created using the combination of markers produced sensitivities between 90 percent and 100 percent in the area of 80 percent to 90 percent specificity, whereas the receiver operator characteristic curve for CA-125 alone resulted in sensitivities of 70 percent to 80 percent. The classification tree analysis for discrimination of benign condition from ovarian cancer used CA-125, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, EGF, and VEGF resulting in 86.5 percent sensitivity and 93.0 percent specificity.</edrn:StudyResults>

    <edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of ovarian cancer might improve clinical outcome. Some studies have shown the role of cytokines as a new group of tumor markers for ovarian cancer. We hypothesized that a panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show strong correlation with the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.</edrn:StudyBackground>

Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:StudyBackground>Affymetrix GeneChip Array and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) are two high throughput methodologies used to profile transcriptomes. Each method has certain strengths and weaknesses; however, no comparison has been made between the data derived from Affymetrix arrays and MPSS. In this study, two lineage-related prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2, were used for transcriptome analysis with the aim of identifying genes associated with prostate cancer progression.</edrn:StudyBackground>

    <edrn:StudyResults>Comparison of the data revealed that both technologies detected genes the other did not. In LNCaP, 3,180 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,169 genes were only detected by MPSS. Similarly, in C4-2, 4,121 genes were only detected by Affymetrix and 1,014 genes were only detected by MPSS. Analysis of the combined transcriptomes identified 66 genes unique to LNCaP cells and 33 genes unique to C4-2 cells. Expression analysis of these genes in prostate cancer specimens showed CA1 to be highly expressed in bone metastasis but not expressed in primary tumor and EPHA7 to be expressed in normal prostate and primary tumor but not bone metastasis.</edrn:StudyResults>

    <edrn:StudyConclusion>Our data indicates that transcriptome profiling with a single methodology will not fully assess the expression of all genes in a cell line. A combination of transcription profiling technologies such as DNA array and MPSS provides a more robust means to assess the expression profile of an RNA sample. Finally, genes that were differentially expressed in cell lines were also differentially expressed in primary prostate cancer and its metastases.</edrn:StudyConclusion>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell culture The lung cancer cells are grown in lysine free media supplemented with 13C6 lysine for 7 passage to insure &amp;gt;90 percent incorporation of isotopic labeled amino acid. Secreted or Shed protein Media was changed to media with 0.1percent dialyzed FBS and incubated for 48 hours prior to collecting the conditioned media. Cells and debris are removed from media by centrifugation at 5000xg and filtration through a 0.22um filter. The conditioned media is then concentrated with Amicon 3K centrifugal filters. Cell surface and membrane proteins Cell surface proteins from 2.0x108 cells will be biotinylated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, solubilized in solution containing Igepal CA-630 with cell disruption by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20000xg. Biotinylated proteins are chromatographically isolated by affinity chromatography using 1ml of Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin. Proteins bound to the column are recovered by reduction of the biotinylation reagent with 5ml of a solution containing 65umol of DTT and 1percent octyl-glucoside. Total cell extracts Total cell extracts are obtained by sonication of 2.0x107cells in 1ml of PBS containing 1percent octyl-glucoside and protease inhibitors followed by sonication and centrifugation at 20000xg. Conditioned media, cell surface proteins and total cell extract were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Each one of the reverse-phase fractions were individually digested in-solution digestion with trypsin and grouped into 24 pools according to chromatographic features. Pools are individually analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ-ORBITRAP mass spectrometer. The acquired mass spectrometric data is analyzed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) analysis pipeline which provides peptide and protein identification. The spectral counting method is used to estimate protein enrichment for each compartment</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.) Tumors: Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples. DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation: Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis: Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 microL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>Characterization of the gene expression profiles of specific cell populations of the human urinary bladder provides an important set of research tools for the study of cellular differentiation and the cancer process. The transcriptome is a definitive identifier of each individual cell types. Surgically resected tissue was digested by collagenase and the different cell types were sorted by antibodies to cluster designation (CD) cell surface antigens. The sorted cells were analyzed by DNA microarrays. The transcriptome datasets were analyzed for differentially expressed genes and plotted on a principal components analysis space for cell lineage relationship. The following bladder cell types were analyzed: CD9+ urothelial, CD104+ basal, CD13+ stromal of lamina propria, CD9+ urothelial carcinoma cancer, and CD13+ urothelial carcinoma-associated stromal. Gene expression differences between the cell types of tumor and their respective non-cancer counterpart provide biomarker candidates. Basal cells of the bladder and prostate, although sharing CD cell surface markers, are quite different in overall gene expression. Furthermore, these cells lack transcript features of stem cell signature of embryonic stem or embryonal carcinoma cells. Cell type-specific transcriptomes are more informative than bulk tissue transcriptomes. The relatedness of different cell types can be determined by transcriptome dataset comparison.</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>Purpose: Recurrent prostate cancer remains a major problem. Staging, grading and prostate specific antigen level at surgery are helpful but still imperfect predictors of recurrence. For this reason there is an imperative need for additional biomarkers that add to the prediction of currently used prognostic factors. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the extent of promoter methylation of genes previously reported as aberrantly methylated in prostate cancer (AIM1, APC, CCND2, GPX3, GSTP1, MCAM, RAR-beta-2, SSBP2 and TIMP3) by quantitative fluorogenic methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We used cancer tissue from a nested case-control study of 452 patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Recurrence cases and controls were compared and the association between methylation extent and recurrence risk was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for patient age at prostatectomy, prostatectomy year, stage, grade, surgical margins and preprostatectomy prostate specific antigen. All statistical tests were 2-sided with p &amp;lt;= 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: The extent of GSTP1 methylation was higher in patients with recurrence than in controls (p = 0.01), especially patients with early disease, ie organ confined or limited extraprostatic extension (p = 0.001). After multivariate adjustment GSTP1 promoter methylation at or above the median was associated with an increased risk of recurrence, including in men with early disease (each p = 0.05). Conclusions: Greater GSTP1 promoter methylation in cancer tissue was independently associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with early prostate cancer. This suggests that GSTP1 promoter methylation may be a potential tissue based recurrence marker.</edrn:DatasetDescription>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell culture The lung cancer cells are grown in lysine free media supplemented with 13C6 lysine for 7 passage to insure &amp;gt;90 percent incorporation of isotopic labeled amino acid. Secreted or Shed protein Media was changed to media with 0.1percent dialyzed FBS and incubated for 48 hours prior to collecting the conditioned media. Cells and debris are removed from media by centrifugation at 5000xg and filtration through a 0.22um filter. The conditioned media is then concentrated with Amicon 3K centrifugal filters. Cell surface and membrane proteins Cell surface proteins from 2.0x108 cells will be biotinylated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, solubilized in solution containing Igepal CA-630 with cell disruption by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20000xg. Biotinylated proteins are chromatographically isolated by affinity chromatography using 1ml of Ultralink Immobilized NeutrAvidin. Proteins bound to the column are recovered by reduction of the biotinylation reagent with 5ml of a solution containing 65umol of DTT and 1percent octyl-glucoside. Total cell extracts Total cell extracts are obtained by sonication of 2.0x107cells in 1ml of PBS containing 1percent octyl-glucoside and protease inhibitors followed by sonication and centrifugation at 20000xg. Conditioned media, cell surface proteins and total cell extract were fractionated by reverse-phase chromatography after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide. Each one of the reverse-phase fractions were individually digested in-solution digestion with trypsin and grouped into 24 pools according to chromatographic features. Pools are individually analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a LTQ-ORBITRAP mass spectrometer. The acquired mass spectrometric data is analyzed by the Computational Proteomics Analysis System (CPAS) analysis pipeline which provides peptide and protein identification. The spectral counting method is used to estimate protein enrichment for each compartment</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of breast cancer might improve clinical outcome. Some studies have shown the role of cytokines as a new group of tumor markers for breast cancer. We hypothesized that a panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show strong correlation with the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.</edrn:StudyBackground>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment. Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number. A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data). Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data). A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &amp;lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &amp;gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping. 60 matched tumor normal pairs Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software.

    <edrn:StudyBackground>Stromal mesenchyme cells play an important role in epithelial differentiation and likely in cancer as well. Induction of epithelial differentiation is organ-specific, and the genes responsible could be identified through a comparative genomic analysis of the stromal cells from two different organs. These genes might be aberrantly expressed in cancer since cancer could be viewed as due to a defect in stromal signaling. We propose to identify the prostate stromal genes by analysis of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal cells, and to examine their expression in prostate cancer.</edrn:StudyBackground>

    <edrn:StudyResults>The bladder stroma was phenotypically different from that of the prostate. Most notable was the presence of a layer of CD13  cells adjacent to the urothelium. This structural feature was also seen in the mouse bladder. The prostate stroma was uniformly CD13-. A number of differentially expressed genes between prostate and bladder stromal cells were identified. One prostate gene, proenkephalin (PENK), was of interest because it encodes a hormone. Secreted proteins such as hormones and bioactive peptides are known to mediate cell-cell signaling. Prostate stromal expression of PENK was verified by an antibody raised against a PENK peptide, by RT-PCR analysis of laser-capture microdissected stromal cells, and by database analysis. Gene expression analysis showed that PENK expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer.</edrn:StudyResults>
    <edrn:ResearchSupport>N.I.H., Extramural</edrn:ResearchSupport>
    <edrn:StudyConclusion>Our findings show that the histologically similar stromas of the prostate and bladder are phenotypically different, and express organ-specific genes. The importance of these genes in epithelial development is suggested by their abnormal expression in cancer. Among the candidates is the hormone PENK and the down-regulation of PENK expression in cancer suggests a possible association with cancer development.</edrn:StudyConclusion>

    <edrn:AnalyticMethods>A decision rule for diagnosing high grade prostate cancer combining MRI results with PSA, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG will be derived. Biomarkers along with MRI score will be combined either by a logistic regression model or using an OR rule generated by grid searching as in Sanda et al.4 The threshold of the model score or individual biomarkers will be searched by maximizing specificity while setting sensitivity at 90% for aggressive cancers.  We assume a panel of PSA, PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG with the sensitivity held constant at 90% in the initial biopsy setting can achieve a specificity at 35% based on Sanda et al.4 We therefore will test the hypothesis specificity at this threshold is not significantly larger than 35%. A one-sided test at alpha 0.05 level will be used.</edrn:AnalyticMethods>

    <edrn:DatasetDescription>40 NSCLC cell lines / 83 lung adenocarcinoma tumor pair</edrn:DatasetDescription>
    <edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary/>
    <edrn:MethodDetails>Cell lines: Forty NSCLC cell lines from Dr. Adi Gazdar's lab were studied. Among them, twenty were obtained from never or light smokers (defined as less than or equal to 15 pack year smoking history), and twenty from heavy smokers (defined as smokers who had more than or equal to 30 pack year smoking history.) Tumors: Eighty-three pairs of lung adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues were provided from British Columbia Cancer Center, Vancouver. Smoking history is available for all the samples. DNA, RNA and cDNA preparation: Genomic DNA was obtained from cell lines by using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. (Applied Biosystems). Mutation analysis: Gene mutation status was analyzed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA or cDNA and direct sequencing of the PCR products. Mutational analysis was performed for EGFR (exons 19-21), KRAS (exon 2), p16 (exons1-3) using genomic DNA; p53 (exon1-11), LKB1 (exon1-9), BRG1 (exon3-37) using cDNA. All PCR reactions were performed in 25 uL volumes containing 100 ng of DNA or cDNA using Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 9700 instrument. PCR products were sequenced using Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry and AB capillary instrumentation. Copy number analysis Gene copy number was determined by SYBR green real-time PCR method. The reactions were performed in Bio-rad DNA Engine Thermal Cycler. The thermal cycling conditions were set to 2 min at 50c,10 min at 95c,followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95c alternating with 1min at 60C. Standard curves for copy numbers were generated using human genomic DNA as reference. DNA copy number ratios were calculated as the average copy number of target locus divided by the average copy number of the reference locus, and then normalized against human genomic DNA. Microarray analysis RNA quality and concentration were checked by the Bio-Rad Experion Bioanalyzer per manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to label the cRNA probes by Ambion Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit (Cat# IL1791). 1.5 ug of the amplified and labeled cRNA probes was hybridized to Illumina Human WG-6 v3.0 Expression BeadChip (Cat# BD-101-0203) overnight at 58 degree C, then washed, blocked and detected by streptavidin-Cy3 per manufacturer's protocol. After drying, the chips were scanned by Illumina iScan system. Bead-level data were obtained, and pre-processed using the R package mbcb for background correction and probe summarization. Pre-processed data were then quantile-normalized and log-transformed.</edrn:MethodDetails>

    <edrn:MethodDetails>41 cell lines Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software. Partek normalization includes background subtraction, probe length adjustment, fragment length adjustment, and GC content adjustment. Analysis was performed following the "Copy Number" workflow using SNP array data for 72 normal HapMap individuals to create a baseline for copy number. A matrix of normalized log2 intensity ratios (tumor cell line:HapMap baseline) for each probe in each sample was generated (level 2 data). Genomic segmentation was performed in Partek to generate a list of segmental copy number alterations in each sample using a 50 marker minimum and a p-value threshold of 10-6 to define copy number altered regions. Segmentation data was parsed into a gene-centric matrix with estimated copy number values for each gene (level 3 data). A copy number = 2 is copy neutral; copy number &amp;lt; 2 is a loss and copy number &amp;gt; 2 is a copy gain. Genes were mapped using base pair coordinates from a table of RefSeq annotated genes downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (March 2006 genome build). Gene accessions with ambiguous mapping were removed from the RefSeq table. For genes with multiple accessions, the accession with the longest transcript was used for mapping. 60 matched tumor normal pairs Raw SNP array data (CEL files = level 1) were imported and processed in Partek Genomics Suite software.
