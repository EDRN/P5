<h3>Biomarker Information</h3>

<p>Biomarker information hosted on the public portal includes both published and unpublished research results from the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN). Summary information describing biomarkers and the associated scientific data that are being researched is provided for all biomarkers captured by the program. Access to unpublished biomarker research results under development by the EDRN is currently only available to EDRN members. In this case, members are provided a username and password that will grant them access to specific data that is hosted on the portal.
</p>

<p>If you are an EDRN member and need access and do not already have a username and password, please complete the <a href='https://www.compass.fhcrc.org/edrns/pub/user/application.aspx?t=app&sub=form1&w=1&p=3&q=4&r=5&s=6&extra1=1&extra2=2&extra3=3'>New User Application</a> which is handled by the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC).

<h3>Scientific Data</h3>

<p>Scientific data (including but not limited to instrument output, images, microscopic slides, annotated and unannotated datasets, collections of data, individual computer files and other electronic documents, non-electronic products, scientific conclusions, calibrated and uncalibrated research, and the like) may appear on this website or may be linked from this site. Such data may result from published and unpublished research from the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN). Summaries and/or full scientific data is undergoing constant research and refinement and access to unpublished data may require authorization and is available only to EDRN members. In these cases members are provided a username and password that will grant access to such data within this website, the EDRN portal, and linked websites, such as LabCAS. Scientific data is by its very nature dynamic and may change over time. The data is not better than the original sources from which they were derived in terms of (but not limited to) accuracy, precision, and scale, and these (and other) factors may vary across data collections and sets of data.
