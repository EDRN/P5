    Although it would be a cool feature to have writers submit their pages for review by executive
    editors, in practice @nutjob4life is the main writer/editor and the others who do so can be
    counted on just one handâ€”and a hand that suffered a terrible accident at that. So, to keep
    from having a repetitive stress injury, we make it so you can one-click "Publish" instead
    of having to click, navigate, and then hit "Publish".
