    Eight diagnostic tests or devices supported by the EDRN have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use and
    <a href='clia-approved-tests'>18 EDRN developed biomarker tests</a>
    are available in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved laboratories.  Details on the EDRN-supported biomarkers that received FDA approval are listed below.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[-2]proPSA</strong>: The FDA approved the test to help determine if a man with a total prostate specific antigen (PSA) between 4–10 ng/mL is likely to have cancer and for whom biopsy is appropriate. This test may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in men unlikely to have cancer. </li>
<li><strong>PCA3</strong>:  Overexpression of the PCA3 gene, measured in urine, is highly specific to prostate cancer. When evaluated with other risk factors, the PROGENSA PCA3 assay helps physicians identify which men suspected of having prostate cancer should undergo a repeat prostate biopsy. </li>
<li><strong>OVA1</strong>:  This test helps detect ovarian cancer in women with a pelvic mass. It identifies those who may benefit from referral to a gynecological oncologist for surgery.</li>
<li><strong>ROMA Algorithm</strong>:  In 2011, FDA cleared ROMA Algorithm (Fujirebio), which uses the CA-125 and HE4 blood markers, to determine the likelihood that an ovarian pelvic mass is malignant. EDRN investigators helped validate CA-125 and HE4 in preclinical samples and develop an algorithm for measuring these markers.</li>
<li><strong>AFPL3% and DCP</strong>:  These markers were approved by the FDA in 2011 as risk assessment tests for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver diseases (Wako Diagnostics). The EDRN performed an independent validation of both AFPL3% and DCP, and subsequently provided Wako blinded specimens to test their new, more sensitive instrument.</li>
<li><strong>Overa</strong>: This test is for determining ovarian cancer risk.  Overa is specifically designed to help determine which patients are at low risk for malignancy and to better identify patients who are at high risk for having a malignancy and, therefore, would benefit from care with a gynecologic oncologist. It was approved by the FDA in 2016, and Vermillion, Inc. offers the test. </li>
<li><strong>CancerSEEK</strong>: Five EDRN investigators participated in the development and testing of CancerSEEK, which is a multianalyte test that simultaneously determines the levels of eight proteins and the presence of cancer gene mutations in circulating DNA. The test is aimed at screening for eight common cancer types that account for more than 60 percent of cancer deaths in the U.S. Five of the cancers covered by the test currently have no screening test. In 2019, Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. received the FDA’s Breakthrough Device designation for the detection of genetic mutations and proteins associated with pancreatic and ovarian cancers.</li>
<li><strong>EsoCheck™</strong>: This device is designed to allow patients to undergo a non-invasive 5 minute office-based procedure to detect Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) without the need for endoscopy.  EsoCheck’s ability to sample cells from a targeted area of the esophagus has the potential to save lives through the early detection of esophageal abnormalities. This device received FDA approval in 2019, and PAVmed markets it.</li>
