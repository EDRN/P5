<p><strong>Please note: the EDRN is suspending the acceptance of applications for Associate Membership categories A and B until further notice. Associate Membership applications category C are still accepted.</strong></p>
<p>The Associate Membership is designed for investigators who are not affiliated with EDRN and wish to propose collaborative studies within the scope and objectives of the EDRN. Investigators planning to become Associate Members are assigned, based on expertise and interest, to one of four site-specific Collaborative Groups: Breast and Gynecologic Cancers; Gastrointestinal and Other Cancers; Lung and Upper Aerodigestive Tract Cancers; or Prostate and Other Urologic Cancers. Investigators' primary contacts are the EDRN Principal Investigators who chair the Collaborative Groups. For details concerning the application process please read the <a href="aprdr" target="_self" class="internal-link" title="Application Procedure, Receipt Dates, and Review">Application Procedure</a> instructions.</p>
<p>There are three categories for Associate Membership:</p>
<p><strong>Category A</strong> Members are domestic or foreign investigators who propose to conduct basic or translational research consistent with the priorities of the EDRN. Supplemental funds provided through Category A Membership are to be used as one-time "seed money" for pilot studies necessary to support applications for future independent funding. Funds are provided for a period of two years and are not renewable. Although support of Category A Members ceases after two years, they are considered to be Associate Members for the duration of the EDRN. Category A Associate Members are invited to participate in Workshops and Steering Committee meetings. The "seed money" will be $50,000 per year for two years in direct costs with additional “Facilities and Administrative” costs (F&amp;A costs).  The applicants are highly encouraged to budget in a way that they can attend two EDRN meetings per year.</p>
<p><strong>Category B</strong> Members contribute to the Network by sharing available technologies, contributing specimens, making available high-risk registries and cohorts, and providing other resources complementary to the Network. They can be domestic or foreign. Category B Members can reapply for funds annually (total funding amount should not exceed $100,000 in direct costs with additional “F&amp;A costs”, unless the Network needs determined by the EC justify additional funding).  Category B Members are considered Associate Members after funding ceases for the duration of the EDRN. Category B Associate Members are invited to participate in Workshops and Steering Committee meetings. Any clinical or laboratory site (other than current BDLs, BRLs and CEVCs) participating in a validation study are considered Category B Members.</p>
<p><strong>Category C</strong> Corresponding Members, are scientists, organizations, clinicians, patient advocates, or ethicists who are interested in participating in Collaborative Group meetings and EDRN Workshops and Conferences yet do not receive funds from the EDRN. Category C Members will be invited to these meetings and conferences, but their expenses will not be supported by the EDRN. Category C members can be domestic or foreign. The application for Category C Members is the similar to that of other Associate Member applicants, with minor modifications: the budgetary document can be disregarded, and the proposal should explain how the applicant’s participation at the meetings and workshops will contribute to the mission of EDRN. Category C Members are considered Corresponding Members for the duration of the EDRN. EDRN Members for which funding has ceased are considered Category C Members for the duration of the EDRN.</p>
