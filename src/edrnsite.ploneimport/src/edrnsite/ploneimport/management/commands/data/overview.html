    The Network Consulting Team (NCT) an ad-hoc group of extramural scientists, is independent of the programmatic oversight provided by the NCI who are appointed by the Director of the Division of Cancer Prevention, NCI. The NCT is a non-voting committee, composed of non-federal scientists, clinicians, patient advocates, and ethicists who are devoid of financial and/or collaborative affiliation with EDRN where a conflict of interest exists or may be apparent. At the recommendation of the Chair, EDRN SC, ad-hoc consultants may be recommended to serve on the NCT. Ad hoc consultants may be called upon for consultation in areas where specific expertise is needed yet lacking in the NCT. Ad hoc consultants may be federal or non-federal scientists, clinicians, patient advocates, and ethicists.
