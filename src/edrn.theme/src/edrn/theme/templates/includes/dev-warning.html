                    This is <em>not</em> an official version of the portal of the Early Detection
                    Research Network. This version is for <a
                    href='https://github.com/EDRN/P5'>public demonstration</a> and review with the
                    <a href='mailto:edrn-ic@jpl.nasa.gov'>Informatics Center</a> and our partners
                    around the country. This demo site is for an application that is developed by
                    JPL but <strong>will not ultimately be hosted at JPL</strong>. It will
                    eventually be run and open to the public at the National Cancer Institute at
                    <code>edrn.nci.nih.gov</code>.

    Update from Rojeh: the URS number is *not* a clearance number, and that's what we need to
    display on the site. On top of that, the clearance number needs to go into the footer, not
    up here.
