    <ns1:aims>The Specific Aims of the HEDS study are:

Aim 1:   (a) To determine the incidence rate and the performance of ultrasound, and the biomarkers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3%, and des-gamma carboxy-prothrombin (DCP), in detecting preclinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (b) To evaluate the performance of novel biomarkers for the detection of preclinical HCC.

Aim 2:   To determine the cost-effectiveness of surveillance strategies for HCC.

Aim 3:   To determine the performance of biomarkers in the prognosis of patients with HCC.

Aim 4:   To establish a biorepository of longitudinally collected biospecimens from this cohort of cirrhotic patients. These biospecimens will form a reference set to be used for future EDRN biomarker validation research.

    <ns1:objective>Part 1:  
The first part of this study is to conduct follow-up for patients that were enrolled in the EDRN Phase 2 Validation Study called DCP (13). For this part of the study, four groups are defined as follows:

a)   Vanguard Controls are cirrhotic controls, from the Phase 2 trial that have not developed HCC and sign a new consent form for HEDS participation. These patients will be followed for a minimum of an additional 24 months and have biospecimens collected every 6 months. 
b)   Vanguard Interval Controls are cirrhotic controls, from the Phase 2 trial that have not developed HCC and do not sign a new consent form for HEDS participation. This group will have outcome data abstracted from their medical records.
c)   Vanguard Interval Cases are cirrhotic controls from the Phase 2 trial that developed HCC after completion of the Phase 2 trial but prior to the current study. This group will have outcome data abstracted from their medical records.
d)   Vanguard Cases are HCC cases from the Phase 2 trial. This group will have outcome data abstracted from their medical records.

Part 2:  
New Controls - The second part of this study is the new accrual of cirrhotic controls at the seven participating sites. These patients will be followed for a minimum of 24 months and have biospecimens collected every 6 months. Data will be collected every 6 months: ultrasound, AFP, liver function tests, complete blood counts, MELD scores and any changes in medical history, personal cancer history and family cancer history.
