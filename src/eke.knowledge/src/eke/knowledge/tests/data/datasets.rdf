        <edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
            Greater GSTP1 promoter methylation in cancer tissue was independently associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with early prostate cancer. 
            This suggests that GSTP1 promoter methylation may be a potential tissue based recurrence marker.
            </edrn:ResultsAndConclusionSummary>
        <edrn:MethodDetails>
            We evaluated the extent of promoter methylation of genes previously reported as aberrantly methylated in prostate cancer (AIM1, APC, CCND2, GPX3, GSTP1, MCAM, RARÎ²2, SSBP2 and TIMP3) by quantitative fluorogenic methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We used cancer tissue from a nested case-control study of 452 patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Recurrence cases and controls were compared and the association between methylation extent and recurrence risk was estimated by logistic regression adjusting for patient age at prostatectomy, prostatectomy year, stage, grade, surgical margins and preprostatectomy prostate specific antigen. 
            All statistical tests were 2-sided with p &lt;= 0.05 considered statistically significant.

        <edrn:StudyConclusion>The presented data show that simultaneous testing of a panel of serum cytokines and CA-125 
        using LabMAP technology may present a promising approach for ovarian cancer detection.

        <edrn:DataSetName>University of Pittsburg Ovarian Data</edrn:DataSetName>
        <edrn:StudyResults>Concentrations of 24 cytokines (cytokines/chemokines, growth, and angiogenic 
        factors) in combination with cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), were measured in sera of 44 patients 
        with early-stage ovarian cancer, 45 healthy women, and 37 patients with benign pelvic tumors. 
        Six markers, i.e., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial 
        growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and CA-125, showed significant 
        differences in serum concentrations between ovarian cancer and control groups. Out of this group, 
        IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, EGF, and CA-125, were used in a classification tree analysis that resulted in 
        84 percent sensitivity at 95 percent specificity. The receiver operator characteristic curve created using the 
        combination of markers produced sensitivities between 90 percent and 100 percent in the area of 80 percent to 90 percent 
        specificity, whereas the receiver operator characteristic curve for CA-125 alone resulted in 
        sensitivities of 70 percent to 80 percent. The classification tree analysis for discrimination of benign 
        condition from ovarian cancer used CA-125, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-6, 
        EGF, and VEGF resulting in 86.5 percent sensitivity and 93.0 percent specificity.

        <edrn:StudyBackground>Early detection of ovarian cancer might improve 
        clinical outcome. Some studies have shown the role of cytokines as a 
        new group of tumor markers for ovarian cancer. We hypothesized that a 
        panel comprised of multiple cytokines, which individually may not show 
        strong correlation with the disease, might provide higher diagnostic power.
        </edrn:StudyBackground>
        <edrn:StudyMethods>To evaluate the diagnostic utility of cytokine panel, we used a novel multianalyte 
        LabMAP profiling technology that allows simultaneous measurement of multiple 
        markers.
